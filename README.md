# ProfessorRicardoSanches_Bootstrap

BOOTSTRAP TRAINIG

This page was made in the course CRIANDO UM SITE COM BOOTSTRAP 4 by Professor Ricardo Sanches, available on his YouTube channel.

In this project it was taught how to use bootstrap commands like: Navbar, Carousel, Scrollspay, Thumbnail, Modal, Nav Pills, Jumbotron, dentre outros.

Although I think bootstrap makes page building much easier and results in a very nice layout, I have preferred not to use it, because at this beginning I want to improve my programming skills without these resources.
